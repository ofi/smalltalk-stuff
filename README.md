##In Memoriam
While compiling this respository I came to know of the sudden passing of James A. Robertson about ten days ago (at the time of writing). He had been a Smalltalk evangelist and a product manager at Cincom for many years. Although I never have had the chance to meet him personally, his articles, talks and screencasts have accompanied my personal Smalltalk life for more than ten years (maybe 20 in fact). The Smalltalk community and myself will miss you Jim, because nobody can fill this gap.
